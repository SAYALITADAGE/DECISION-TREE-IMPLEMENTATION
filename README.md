"The goal of this task is to build and visualize a Decision Tree model using Python’s Scikit-Learn library to classify or predict outcomes on a chosen dataset. A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that works like a flowchart. It splits the data into branches based on feature conditions to reach a decision at the leaf nodes. Decision Trees are widely used because they are simple to understand, easy to interpret, and effective for both classification and regression tasks.

In this task, the Iris dataset is used as an example. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable represents the species of the flower, which can be Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica. Using this dataset allows for a clear demonstration of how the Decision Tree algorithm classifies input data into distinct categories.

The first step involves loading the dataset and exploring its structure using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Understanding the dataset is crucial for identifying the input features and the target variable. Next, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, typically with 80% of the data used for training the model and 20% reserved for testing its performance. This ensures that the model can generalize well to unseen data.

After splitting the data, a Decision Tree Classifier is created using Scikit-Learn’s DecisionTreeClassifier class. The model is trained on the training set, which allows it to learn patterns and relationships between the features and the target classes. Once the model is trained, it is used to predict the target values for the test set. The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which provide insights into how well the model classifies the data.

A critical part of this task is visualizing the trained Decision Tree. Visualization helps to understand the decision-making process of the model, showing how the data is split at each node based on feature thresholds. Each node in the tree represents a feature test, branches indicate possible outcomes, and leaves represent the final classification. This makes Decision Trees highly interpretable compared to other complex machine learning models.

Finally, a brief analysis of the results is included. The analysis highlights the accuracy of the model, the effectiveness of using a Decision Tree for this dataset, and observations about how features contribute to classification. It also provides an understanding of the strengths and limitations of Decision Trees, such as their susceptibility to overfitting if the tree grows too deep, and the need for careful parameter tuning.

Deliverable: The complete task is submitted as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb), containing all code, outputs, tree visualizations, and the analysis. This notebook demonstrates both the practical implementation of a machine learning model and the ability to present results clearly and effectively. Completing this task helps students develop essential skills in Python programming, machine learning model building, evaluation, and visualization, which are valuable for academic and professional projects".
